              <p>This project is a virtual guitar pedal board. It allows the user to connect, disconnect and move around effect pedals around the screen and by doing so, to control the sound input. I've created four effect pedals, using Maximilian's delay, distortion, chorus and flanger. Each pedal has knobs that control the effect's parameters, an audio input and an audio output. By simply dragging the mouse from an audio output of a pedal, and dropping on an audio input of another pedal the user is able to connect the two and by that pass the audio between them.</p>

                <hr>
                <p>Based on <a href="http://soundlab.cs.princeton.edu/software/sndpeek/">sndpeek</a>, I have created a simple 3D FFT and spectral centroid visualiser. I found that displaying how the FFT spectrum changes over time is not only visually interesting, but is also useful in order to help user discover the spectrum "signature" (overall shape) of sounds. In order to make this visualiser more enjoyable and interactive, I also made it possible to change input types between microphone, audio file and a sine oscillator.</p>

                <hr>
                <p>A simple implementation of a lowpass and highpass filters. The users are presented with a box in which they could control the cutoff frequency and the resonanse value of the filter. I also provide a simple visualisation of the sound buffer both in the time domain and in the frequency domain, in order to show in real time how the filtering affects the sound.</p>

                <h3 class="text-center">Interactive oscillators</h3>
                <hr>
                <p>A nice tool that allows the user to play and display an oscillator. The type of oscillator could be chosen from between sine, sqaure, triangle and sawtooth. After choosing an oscillator, the user can dynamically change its frequency by dragging the mouse up or down. I've made this tool also for personal use. I feel that it would help me to better explain to beginners the differences between oscillators, both in the sound they make and in the way they are constructed, as well as what exactly happens when we increase/decrease their frequency.</p>

                <hr>
                <p>A small and funny tool that converts the sound of a human speaking to a monster, a robot or an alien. In order to implement this I have used Maximilian's pitch stretching mechanism. I was originally hoping to have this tool work on microphone input, but the way Maximilian's pitch stretching is implemented made it impossible.</p>
